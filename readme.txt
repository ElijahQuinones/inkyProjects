This Project is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi with the Inky display from Pimoroni.

This is a project meant to help someone learn spanish words every day.
It pulls from a list of the top 10,000 most used spainsh words.
It then sends these words to chatgpt to ask for a translation and use in a sentance.
Finally it removes the word displayed on the Inky screen so that you will not get the same definiton twice.
